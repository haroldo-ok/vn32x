This is a tool for creating graphic novels for the Sega 32X.
Work in progress.

Implemented so far
------------------

* Scripts for converting images to the proper format;
* 32K color mode;

* Antialised variable width font text rendering;
* Word wrapping for the text;
* Joypad input;
* Word wrapping for the text boxes;
* Menus;
* Some image decompression caching to speed up image rendering.

Not implemented, but planned
----------------------------

* Implement a tool to automatically generate C source code from Ren'Py scripts;
* Digital audio playback;
* A visual editor for the scripts (maybe as a separate project?).
